Clawshot(s) will shoot as far as you need them to and return in a mater of seconds (it's max distance happens when shot into the sky and causes the game to lag while it's launching, if let it go max distance it will take 7 seconds to go out and come back due to lag). The best part (and hardest to hack) is the fact that it will attach to anything. Point, shoot, and you're there. (Sacred Grove, anyone?)
