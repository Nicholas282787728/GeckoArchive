For the 10 million score and 999 credits, those are just examples I provided. You can change the actual values to anything you would like. If you are not sure of the proper value, use a decimal to hex calculator (windows calculator does this) - enter the desired value in decimal, convert to hex, and replace my values (00989690 (score) and 000003e7 (credits) respectively).
