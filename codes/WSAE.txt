Time Modifier [farjo08]
04353EBC XXXXXXXX

Score Modifier [farjo08]
0424313C XXXXXXXX

Notes:

1) For Time and Score Modifier, replace XXXXXXXX with a hex value. Keep in mind that the time for each mission is different and some require the time limit to run out - so be sure you know what you are doing if using that code and/or use it through WiiRD so you can enable/disable as needed.

2) The ammo codes will work for all levels of weapons. The current values were set to the level 1 maximum but these will give infinite ammo / no reload.

3) For all health codes except player (i.e. base, ship, etc) I would advise only using when playing a mission where they are applicable. I did play through the entire campaign on different difficulties and while the addresses remain static I have run across a rare enemy or hive that could not be destroyed until I disabled those codes (it appears that game may use the same memory address for different things depending on the level).

If anyone wants to make modifiers (enablers/disablers, etc) to these codes feel free to do so. I'm done with hacking this game and covered pretty much everything (I was unable to determine how the weapon upgrades unlock - that's about the only thing missing at this point).
