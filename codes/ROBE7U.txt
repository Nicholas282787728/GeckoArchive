The 0000270F can be changed to whatever you like (currently 9999) but whatever you make it will make those items infinite. For the Ammo, this is only for the hand gun and the reserve (not the clip). For some reason I was unable to find the actual ammo in the clip. I might look a bit more into this game, but please no requests. If you have any issues or problems let me know. I need to read up more on how to find floats (I assume this game is using floats for actual health) and how to use WiiRd to find them.
