# GeckoArchive
A plaintext archive of geckocodes.org, a site dedicated to the sharing of codes for the Gecko engine.

## About
On October 5th, 2020, geckocodes.org was closed, leaving a landing page. All other pages appear to be deleted or redirect to the message. GeckoCodes was the premier site for sharing codes; it was integrated into the Dolphin Emulator. This repository is intended to preserve the tens of thousands of user contributed codes so that they may not be lost.
Currently, this Repository contains an incomplete listing of the Codes Directory, which contains plaintext files. In the best case scenario, this is all that this repository will contain.

## Issues
The Archive.org repository of the /codes directory is missing a large portion of the site's content. I am seeking alternative sources for the missing content.

## Sources
- Archive.org
